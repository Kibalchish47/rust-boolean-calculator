# Boolean-logic evaluator in Rust
This is a basic calculator, written with @Sammy99Jsp's assistance, intended to teach me how to write code in Rust. 

It includes basic functionality, such as : 
- Various logical operations ("gates")
  - AND
  - OR
  - NAND
  - NOR
  - XAND
  - XOR
  - XNAND
  - XNOR
- Error handling (the program repeats the question until the user provides a satisfactory answer).
- "mem" feature (as in "memory"), which allows the user to reuse the previous output of the program.
- NOT gate, which negates the input (i.e. 'not True' -> 'False').
- "exit" feature, which safely terminates the program.
